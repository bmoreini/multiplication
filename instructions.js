/* MULTIPLICATION QUIZ KATA */

/* Simple */
// 1. Print 2 Random Integers, X & Y, each between 3 and 9, as a soluble equation:  X * Y = ??
// 2. Receive manual input for solution, say "Correct!" if match, "Incorrect!" if not.

/* While Loop */
// 3. Embed input in While loop that continues until entry matches solution, or = "stop".

/* For Loop */
// 4. Embed all code in a For loop and run it 3 times. End loop if someone entered "stop".

/* questioner Function */
// 5. Move code parts 1-3 into a function called questioner and call questioner within the For loop.
// 6. Count how many wrong answers are given (up to 1 per question).

/* userInput Function */
// 7. Make a separate function to process user input. Return wrong (0 or 1) to questioner.

/* quiz results */
// 8. At "stop" or loop end, report # answers wrong.  If no wrong answers, say "Charlie, you've won!"

/* setup Function*/
// 9. before beginning loop, ask user how many questions and ask user what the top range for factors should be (e.g. 3-6)
// 10. ask user what the bottom range for factors should be (e.g. 2-5)
