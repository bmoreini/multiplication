/* MULTIPLICATION QUIZ KATA */

/* Simple */
// 1. Print 2 Random Integers, X & Y, each between 3 and 9, as a soluble equation:  X * Y = ??
// 2. Receive manual input for solution, say "Correct!" if match, "Incorrect!" if not.

/* While Loop */
// 3. Embed input in While loop that continues until entry matches solution, or = "stop".

/* For Loop */
// 4. Embed all code in a For loop and run it 3 times. End loop if someone entered "stop".

/* multiPractice Function */
// 5. Move code parts 1-3 into a function called multiPractice and call multiPractice within the For loop.

/* multiPractice Error Count */
// 6. Count how many not-right-first-answers and return that count from multiPractice.

/* quiz results */
// 7. At "stop" or loop end, report # answers wrong.  If no wrong answers, say "Charlie, you've won!"

/* setup */
// 8. before beginning loop, ask user how many questions
// 9. ask user what the top range for factors should be (e.g. 3-6)
// 10. ask user what the bottom range for factors should be (e.g. 2-5)
